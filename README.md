# Core Breach

**Core Breach** is a fast-paced 2D action tower defense game created for the [Kenney Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025). You command a lone ship tasked with defending a vital power core from waves of increasingly aggressive enemies. Build turrets, deploy shields, and unleash devastating power blasts to hold the line.

This is my first ever game jam projectâ€”designed, developed, and submitted within the jam timeframe. The game explores the theme of **"power"** by combining strategic defense mechanics with dynamic offensive abilities.
